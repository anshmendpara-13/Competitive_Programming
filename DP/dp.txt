understand a DP problem
- count total no of ways
- min/max output
- try all possible way (best way)

1. try to represent in term of index
2. do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problme statement
3. sum of all stuffs -> count all ways
4. min (of all stuffs) -> if find min


** memoization (top-down)
** tebulation (bottom-up)

if we have use some index value in problme freqntly so space optimisation are there.
