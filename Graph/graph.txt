undirected graph 
directed graph

node - vertex
links - edges 

cycles in graph - start from a node and end to that node

degrees of grpah - total no of edged inside or outside to that

edge weight - unit weight (by default)

connected/unconnected components

visited array
 
*** 4-direction

*** 8-direction
int dr[] = {-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1};
int dc[] = {-1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1};


**** Euler's Characteristic ****

Euler's characteristic is a fundamental formula in topology that relates the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) of a polyhedron. For a convex polyhedron, Euler's characteristic states:

𝑉+𝐹−𝐸=2

Vertices (V): The number of corner points of the polyhedron.
Edges (E): The number of line segments between the vertices.
Faces (F): The number of polygonal regions including the outer face.

*** pick theorem *** 
Using the adjusted area (twice the actual area) and boundary points, we calculate the number of interior points using:
 
Interior Points= Area− (BoundaryPoints)/2 +1

*** cuboid area ***
A=2(lw+lh+wh)
