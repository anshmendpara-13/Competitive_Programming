prestoring and fetching called hashing 
so, we make hash array/ freqency array

inside main array max size is 10^5  || bool array 10^7
globle array max size is 10^7 || bool array 10^9

globle default declare is zero

a = 97
A = 65
0 = 48


*** map and unordered_map ***
map<key,value> 
unordered_map<key,value>

time complexity in map : storing and fetching log(N) in all cases :: this store in sorted manner
in unordered_map : storing  and fetching O(1) best and O(N) worst :: not particular order

hashing : division method, folding method, mid square method
                (%10)
        chain-in-sorted-order

collision : huge chain so called (all have same hash number so collision occure)
